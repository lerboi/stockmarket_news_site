I plan to build a SaaS platform that delivers filtered, actionable market news and insights for active traders and investors, starting with penny stocks and eventually scalable to the broader market. Retail traders today face an overwhelming flood of press releases, SEC filings, FDA filings, and general market news, most of which is noise, hype, or misleading promotions. By the time traders sift through it, the opportunity to act may be gone. This platform solves that problem by combining automated data collection with AI-driven filtering, summarization, and relevance scoring, delivering only the information that has potential to move markets.

I just created fresh next-app setup with App router, Tailwind, and only javascript. My goal now is to setup the main dashboard in the webapp where the news will be displayed. Do not include any dummy data, just the layout so i can see what i am kind of working with. 

For the design, make it mostly dark themed background white brighter text. Ensure it is also mobile friendly and build to work on both mobile and desktop. Keep it organised and create a "components" folder and for the dashboard, keep all components from the main dashboard page in a "dashboard" folder within the "components" folder.

 Do not write any code yet, just give me what you plan to implement.


For the Dashboard page:
- My /api/fda/device-approvals, drug approvals, and all is fetching news from 2024. I want it to only fetch news from the last 30 minutes on this day. Without writing any code, can you identify the issue and let me konw what the issue is?

For ProfilelModal:
- Remove Account Status
- Fix sign out button, showing below error when clicked and cant sign out
  In HTML, <button> cannot be a descendant of <button>.
  This will cause a hydration error.

For Register Modal:
- Remove 'Full Name' input box requirement
- Add PAassword validation and realtime updating password check that shows if password is strong enough, with a minimum of 8 characters.
