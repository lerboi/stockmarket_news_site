Got it! Here's an updated wireframe for your MVP that puts the focus more on the **news** and **AI relevance scores**, ensuring the most impactful stories are front and center on the dashboard:

---

### **Wireframe for MVP Dashboard: Focused on News & AI Relevance Confidence Scores**

---

### 1. **Header (Top Bar)**

* **Logo** (Top-left, clickable to home)
* **Navigation Bar**:

  * **Dashboard** (Active)
  * **Watchlist**
  * **News History**
  * **Settings**
  * **Profile** (User settings, logout)
* **Search Bar** (For quick stock ticker lookup)

### 2. **Main Dashboard: News-Focused**

#### **a. News Feed (Main Area - Centered)**

* **Section Title**: "Latest High-Impact News"

* **News Items**: A **list or grid view** displaying the highest relevance news items based on the AI's confidence score (this will be dynamic and constantly updated).

  * **News Headline**: Bold and easy to scan.
  * **Source/Type**: (e.g., FDA Filing, SEC Filing, PRNewswire)
  * **Time of Release**: Shows how recent the news is (e.g., "Just Now," "1 hour ago").
  * **AI Summary**: A short, concise summary generated by AI for quick reading.
  * **Why It Matters**: A “Why it matters” line that highlights the key actionable insights from the news. Traders want to know *why* this is important.
  * **Relevance Confidence Score**: A score out of 10 based on how likely the AI thinks this news will affect stock prices (e.g., “8.5/10 - Likely to cause short-term movement”).
  * **Ticker**: Display which stock the news is related to, clickable to navigate to more details about that stock.

*Example of a News Item:*

* **Headline**: “XYZ Corp Receives FDA Approval for Heart Drug”
* **Source**: FDA Filing
* **Time**: 15 minutes ago
* **AI Summary**: “FDA grants approval for XYZ’s new treatment for heart disease, marking a major milestone.”
* **Why It Matters**: “FDA approval could drive a significant rise in XYZ’s stock price by boosting earnings potential.”
* **Confidence Score**: 9/10 (AI analysis suggests strong market reaction)

*The list is sorted by **highest relevance score** (AI confidence score) at the top.*

* **Filter by**:

  * **Ticker**: Select specific tickers you want to follow.
  * **Type**: Filter by news type (e.g., PR, FDA filings, SEC filings).

  * **Most Recent**: Sort by the latest news first.

#### **c. Ticker-Specific News (Sidebar or Expandable Section)**

* **My Watchlist**:

  * **Active Tickers**: A list of penny stocks that the user has added to their watchlist.
  * **Click to view**: When clicking on a ticker, the news feed should only show the relevant news for that ticker, sorted by highest relevance.
  * **Volume Spike Indicator**: Show if there’s been any unusual volume for tickers in the watchlist.

### 3. **Watchlist (Sidebar or Bottom Section)**

### **Mobile Optimization Considerations:**

1. **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the news feed, filter options, and watchlist work seamlessly on mobile screens.
2. **Collapsible Sidebar**: On mobile, convert the watchlist and filter options into a collapsible sidebar or expandable dropdown.
3. **Sticky Header**: Keep important elements like search, profile, and settings accessible at the top.
4. **Infinite Scroll**: Allow the news feed to load more stories as the user scrolls, avoiding the need for pagination.

---

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Data Integration**: Begin integrating data sources for PR, SEC, and FDA filings that are relevant to penny stocks.
2. **AI Filtering & Summarizing**: Focus on training or integrating an AI model that will automatically filter out noise and summarize the news for each ticker.
3. **UI Design**: Create a simple, easy-to-navigate design based on this wireframe, making sure it prioritizes the news and relevance score.
4. **User Testing**: Test the interface with real traders to ensure they find the most relevant news first and can quickly make decisions based on the summaries.

This layout focuses entirely on delivering the most relevant news with clear, actionable insights for your users. Let me know if you'd like to refine any details further!
