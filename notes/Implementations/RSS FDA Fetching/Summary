You are integrating the **FDA API** into your web app to **fetch real-time FDA filings**, such as **drug approvals** and **clinical trial results**, by making **periodic requests** (e.g., every hour or daily). Once the data is fetched, you will **filter and process** the filings using **AI** to identify **market-moving events** (e.g., positive drug approvals). The relevant, actionable data will be pushed to the **web dashboard in real-time** using **WebSockets** or **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**, providing traders with up-to-date insights on drug-related filings that could potentially move the market.
